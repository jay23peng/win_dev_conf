# DEV_HOME

My personal development environment configuration.

Generally, `tumx + vim + zsh` is the best practice for a development environment. In different platform we use different software to achieve the same practice.

## Windows

### Adjust Font Size

For windows 7, Go to `personalize->Window Color->Item`, change every font size of Item to `Microsoft Yahei UI, 10`.

### ConEmu

1.  Get the latest [ConEmu](https://conemu.github.io/).
2.  Copy `ConEmu.xml` from repo and overwrite the `C:\Program Files\ConEmu`.

### Python

For matching with current `vim8`, install [python3.5.2](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-352/)(actually 3.x should be fine) as dependency of [LeaderF](https://github.com/Yggdroot/LeaderF). Restart machine after installation is done to make sure path is setting up correctly.

### Git

Either [Git for windows](https://git-for-windows.github.io/) or Embedded git inside [Source Tree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/) should be fine.


### Gvim

1. 64-bit vim is incomplete installer, so as 1st step, get formal `Gvim` installer from [here](ftp://ftp.vim.org/pub/vim/pc/gvim80-586.exe), and install it.

2. For python support, Get [Vim](https://github.com/vim/vim-win32-installer) and overwrite the files in former installation.

3. Install Vundle by git:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/gmarik/vundle.git "<your vim home>/.vim/Vundle.vim"
   ```
   Or download and copy to `<your vim home>/.vim/Vundle.vim`.

4. Put ``_vimrc`` to your Vim Installation folder. ( May need [powerline-fonts](https://github.com/powerline/fonts) )

5. Invoke vim, run ``PluginInstall``.

6. The `open in exist vim` function in `Gvim` is incomplete. For now, copy `gvim.bat` to `C:\windows` for overwriting the default. Change the context menu to use this script too.

7. When open multiple files in one `Gvim` through vim server, there is a bug that the height of status bar will be calculated into window size. The best practice for now, is auto hide the status bar at left or right side and use large icon.

### FZF(With)

Get [with](https://github.com/jesse23/with) and install it manually.

### MISC

Other software that used on Windows Platform:

* [ALTRun](https://github.com/etworker/ALTRun)
* [KeePass](https://keepass.info/)
* [mactype](https://github.com/snowie2000/mactype)
* [MultiDesk](http://www.syvik.com/multidesk/index_chs.htm)
* [Unlocker](https://unlocker.en.softonic.com/)
* [XMing](https://sourceforge.net/projects/xming/)

### Trouble Shoot

#### "Unknown Publisher" Warning

https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/askie/2009/06/19/how-to-bypass-the-security-warning-unknown-publisher-with-the-checkbox-always-ask-before-opening-this-file/

### VIM Starts very slow

If your `$HOME` is a remote location, starting `vim` will be very slow. As a hack, you can reset the `HOME` folder in `gvim.bat` and `vim.bat`:

```shell
set HOME=C:\xxxxx
```

## MSYS2

[MSYS2](http://www.msys2.org) is a simplify version of [cygwin](https://www.cygwin.com/).

### Installation

1. Get binary from http://www.msys2.org/ and install.

2. Download the latest [conemu-msys2-64.exe](https://github.com/Maximus5/cygwin-connector/releases) to `C:\msys64\usr\bin`.

3. Invoke bash, run `pacman -Syu` couple of times to upgrade to latest.

4. Common `pacman` commands:

   ```bash
   pacman -Syu             # Update package DB and core package
   pacman -Su              # Restart msys and run this after Syu
   pacman -Q               # List all packages
   pacman -Ss <keyword>    # Seach available packages
   pacman -S <package>     # Install package
   pacman -R <package>     # Remove package
   pacman -U <file>        # Install old version downloaded from repo.msys2.org
   ```

### Git

Since `msys-git` is very slow, we can use either [Git for Windows](https://git-for-windows.github.io/) or embedded git in `Source Tree` by add git dependency in `~/.bashrc`:

```bash
export PATH='/c/Program Files/Git/cmd':$PATH
```

Add config below to redirect `vim` properly:

```bash
git config --global core.editor /usr/bin/vim
```

### Emacs

1. Install emacs by `paceman -S msys/emacs`.
2. Get [SPACEMACS](http://spacemacs.org/) and  ``.spacemacs`` from repo extract it to home folder `C:\msys64\home\<username>`.

### Vim

1. `pacman -S msys/vim`.
2. Copy `_vimrc` to `C:\msys64\home\<username>`.
3. Get [Vundle](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim) and put it into `C:\msys64\home\<username>\.vim_home\Vundle.vim`. ( not required if share with `Gvim`)
4. Login to vim and run `PluginInstall`.

### Zsh

1. `pacman -S msys/zsh`.

2. Install [powerline](https://github.com/powerline/powerline):

   ```bash
   pacman -S msys/python3-pip
   pip install powerline-status
   ```

3. Install powerline fonts from [here](https://github.com/powerline/fonts). Manual Install is required on Windows and set it in conEmu properly.

4. Install [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh):

   ```bash
   sh -c "$(wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/master/tools/install.sh -O -)"
   ```

5. Modify `~/.zshrc` to change theme to `agnoster`.

6. Modify `~/.bashrc` to change default shell to zsh by appending line below:

   ```bash
   exec zsh
   ```

7. For accelerate git, run command below:

   ```bash
   git config --global core.preloadindex true
   git config --global core.fscache true
   git config --global gc.auto 256
   ```

8. For debug zsh, use `zsh -xv`.

9. If zsh is slow when access to large git project, run command below:

   ```shell
   git config --add oh-my-zsh.hide-dirty 1
   git config --add oh-my-zsh.hide-status 1
   ```

10. For command wrapper, better to use script below than alias - looks the completion for alias in `zsh` needs to configure separately:

  ```bash
  exec <your-command> "$@"
  ```

### The Silver Searcher(Ag)

`ripgrip` does not exist in `msys2` yet because of go support, use [the_silver_searcher](https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher) as replacement:

```bas
pacman -S mingw64/mingw-w64-x86_64-ag
```

### Fuzzy Finder

For now I don't find a proper fuzzy finder solution for `msys`.

## MacOS

### Keyboard

I use `ThinkPad Compact Bluetooth Keyboard with TrackPoint`. 2 steps below needed for make if work proper.

1. Install [USB OverDrive](http://www.usboverdrive.com/USBOverdrive/News.html) to disable mouse mid-click.
2. Run [tpkb](https://github.com/unknownzerx/tpkb/releases) to switch the Fn Key.
3. Switch `Ctrl` and `cap lock` key by Mac's system preference.

### HomeBrew

```shell
brew list
brew cask list
brew install <package>
brew uninstall <package>
```

### iTerm2

`iTerm2` is the most public choice in macOS as console emulator. Install it by:

```bash
brew cask install iterm2
```

### zsh

1. `brew install zsh`

2. Set `iterm2` default command to `zsh`. Restart `iterm2` to make sure it works. Set `zsh` as default will pollute other application like `VS Code`, so this apprach will be better.

3. Insall pip by `sudo easy_install pip`.

4. Intall power-line by `pip install powline-status`.

5. Install fonts from [here](https://github.com/powerline/fonts).

6. Select a font end with `power-line`.

7. Install `oh-my-zsh`:

   ```bash
   sh -c "$(wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/master/tools/install.sh -O -)"
   ```

8. run `vim ~/.zshrc`, change the theme to `agnoster`.

9. For debug zsh, use `zsh -xv`.

### Tmux

iTerm2 has split and tab function already, did not use Tmux for now.

`brew install tmux`

### Emacs

Emacs is mainly used for support `VimOrganizer` for `orgmode` currently.

1. Get emacs from Homebrew.

   ```shell
    brew cask install emacs
   ```

2. Get [SPACEMACS](http://spacemacs.org/) and extract it to ``emacs_home``.

3. Get ``.spacemacs`` and put it to ``emacs_home``.

4. For dired-quick-sort, ``gls`` is needed from ``coreutils``.

   ```shell
   brew install coreutils
   ```

   **NOTE** For cleaning SPACEMACS, not only clean elpa folder, but also remove auto-gen var in ``.spacemacs``.

### MacVim

1. Install VIM by `brew cask intall macvim`.
2. Get Vundle by either download or git pull.
3. Put ``_vimrc`` to ``$HOME``.
4. Invoke vim, run ``PluginInstall``.

### Change Machine Name

```bash
sudo scutil --set ComputerName "newname"
sudo scutil --set LocalHostName "newname"
sudo scutil --set HostName "newname"
```

Because firefox is deprecating old extension, the latest availble version of Waterfox is `54.0.1`.

1. Install firefox/waterfox.
2. Download [Pentadactyl](http://5digits.org/pentadactyl). After 50.0, use [Signed Version](https://github.com/willsALMANJ/pentadactyl-signed/releases)

### Nerd Fonts

Nerd fonts provide extra symbol when compare with power-line fonts. For now for avoiding any side effect, I am still using power-line fonts:
