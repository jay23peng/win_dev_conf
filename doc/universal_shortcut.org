#+TITLE: Universal Shortcut
#+STARTUP: overview
#+OPTIONS: \n:t
* Concept
For all the applicatons use lot of shortcuts, we can try to set same shortcut to get consistent experience. Especially for the cli toobox which has similar mechanism.
* Principle
- Align with vi principle for 'edit mode' and 'easy motion'.
  - Align with vim shortcut as much as possible
- Try not to break existing critical heavily used shortcut across the application.
  - For example, [C-b d] in tmux is detach but in vi it is delete, it is good to not change it.

* Notes
** approach
- hjkl => switch pane (tmux) / window (vim,emacs,vscode)
- HJKL => move pane (tmux) / window (vim,emacs,vscode)
- pn   => go to preview and next window(tmux) / buffer (vim,emacs,vscode)
- u    => go to last used window(tmux) / buffer (vim,emacs,vscode)
- %    => split vertically
- "    => split horizontally
- x    => kill pane (tmux) / window (vim,emacs,vscode)
- X    => kill other panes (tumx) / kill other buffer (vim/emacs)
- ,    => rename window (tmux) / buffer (vim,emacs,vscode)
- m    => maximize pane (tmux) / window (vim,emacs,vscode)
- N    => move pane (tmux) / window (vim,emacs,vscode) to new window (tmux) / process (vim,emacs,vscode)
* Basic Layout Concept
   - tmux  => session > window > pane
   - vim   => process > buffer > window
   - emacs => process > buffer > window
** tmux shortcut origin
*** pane
   - split pane horizontally  => C-b "
   - split pane vertically    => C-b %

   - switch pane              => C-b o
   - switch pane by number    => C-b q <num>
   - move between pane        => C-b {}<>

   - toggle maximize pane     => C-b z
   - kill pane                => C-b x

   - move pane to window      => C-b +
   - restore pane from window => C-b -

*** window
   - create window        => C-b c
   - list window          => C-b w
   - next window          => C-b n
   - last window          => C-b p
   - find window          => C-b f
   - name window          => C-b ,
   - kill window          => C-b &

*** session
   - new session          => :new<CR>
   - list session         => s
   - name session         => $
   - detach session       => d

*** copy mode
   - enter copy mode      => C-b Return

** vim shortcut origin
*** window
   - split window right   => C-w v
   - split window bottom  => C-w s
   - jump between windows => C-w hjkl or arrow
   - move windows         => C-w HJKL

   - maximize window      => C-w T
   - max win => normal    => C-w S
   - cancel split window  => C-w q or just :q
*** buffer
   - create buffer        => :tabnew
   - delete buffer        => :bd
   - next buffer          => :bn
   - last buffer          => :bp
   - rename buffer        => :file newname (actually rename a file)
   - find buffer          => :b <part of file name> (or number)

*** other util
   - fzf                  => C-p
   - suspend program     => C-z  -> go to shell, fg come back. exit will leave an alive vim process

** doom emacs
*** window
   - new window *new*     => SPC-w-n
   - split window right   => SPC-w-s
   - split window bottom  => SPC-w-v
   - jump between windows => SPC-w-hjkl
   - move windows         => SPC-w-HJKL

   - maximize-window      => SPC-w-m-m
   - largen-window        => SPC-w-o (doomwindow/enlargen??)
   - quit window          => SPC-w-q
   - delete window        => SPC-w-d

** creat buffer
   - create buffer        => SPC-b-N
   - delete buffer        => :bd or SPC-b-d
   - next buffer          => :bn or SPC-b-n
   - last buffer          => :bp or SPN-b-p
   - find buffer          => :b <first char of file name> (or number)
                             S

* Side Notes
- tmux has several annoying bindng like s, d, o, z which will be hard for no-break remap.
- buffer is not exactly same thing as tmux window. It is more like 'model' when vim window means 'view'.
- Tmux only has one level leader key but needs to cover 3 level use case.
  - Browser like tmux doesn't have leader key for browser level short cut. Need to consider that and avoid conflict
